what I do everyday, but now in 2022 and further!

## July 19, 2022. 
  This marks the beginning of my journal. I'll be talking aboat either my training with coding or just everyday life. Today my family and I made Char Siu, which is a Cantonese barbecued pork. We messed up on the marinade, adding all  of the ingredients in the recipe instead of just the marinade ones. We remade the marinade, it turned out good. This summer I've been playing alot of modded Terraria with my friends. Terraria is an 2d action/adventure game. The mod we use is called Calamity, which adds multiple bosses, weapons, and armor and a new class, the Rogue. I chose the Rogue for my new playthrough and I've been having a great time. Rogue has a stealth meter, which allows altered, stronger attacks when charged. Bosses' hp goes goodbye! Though I feel like my friends can't really keep up since they have an hour to play, while I can play as much as I want. There's a very late game weapon you can get from the start of the game called the Murasama. While you can get Murasama very early, you need to have a special ID or defeat a lategame boss to unlock it. My friends found the ID and now are constantly begging me to let them destroy bosses with it. I say no because it will ruin the game progression. But maybe I'll just let them have fun.

  In Calamity I recently entered hardmode, after slaying the Wall of Flesh(wof). This makes monsters more tanky and damaging, and two new biomes appear. First is the Hallow, a sparkling fairytale enviroment with deadly unicorns and rainbow slimes. Then the alien Astral Infection, a dark, purple haze with other worldly creatures. Hardmode also allows for better armor and equipment. I headed to the Astral infection to get Titan hearts, which are used to make Titan armor. Then, I mined for hardmode ore to get a new anvil. Making a very powerful Frequency Manipulator, a javalin that explodes into homing energy bolts. Very cool stuff. I had killed the Cryogen, a floating ice prison that shoots ice crystals that slow you down. Cryogen just turning the game into a bullet hell, as getting hit by one projectiles makes you move so slow you just get half of your health deleted. Though I cheesed the boss by hiding beneath a large disk of blocks to shield myself. I'm planning to summon the Cryogen more so that I can get all of it's drops. Hardmode enemies have a chance to drop Essences, which can be used in a variety of crafting. Currently I need Essence of Eleum to craft the Kelvin Catalyst, a huge ice boomerang. Besides Calamity, I'm going to learn about html. I don't really know much about it, so I'm excited and nervous. I did learn a bit in school. But they always use those blocks, so I  forget everything since all the code looks the same. Reminds me, some of my friends were in the same class and they had a good time with the blocks. Then came some actual lines of code. They HATED it, because it just looked like black and white to them. I somewhat understood it, there were many times I had no idea what was going on. My thoughts on html is "This looks complicated!". There are a bunch of symbols, and that intimidated me. Even basic code looked crazy! I think things will go fine though, since my dad is an analogy master.

  For lunch we decided to make spagetti. Unfortunately, yesterday my family bought our ingredients very late at around 7. The butchers were gone so we couldn't get the regular sausage meat, only the pre-packaged ground stuff. When we started cooking the ground beef, it wasn't like sausage at all. It was very oily. Oil poured out of the meat, and we had enough to cook all the other vegetables. At least we save oil? Ground meat is brittle too, turning into small bits as I cooked it. All the oil and small bits overpowered everything else, so we added another can of tomato sauce, and it was fine. My mom came up with the idea to add parmesan cheese into the mix. At first I doubted it. But I noticed that the cheese would melt and turn stringy. That was a good choice! One of my friends invited me to go camping with them next week.I asked what the plan was, but they said they just started planning, and they wanted permission from my dad. My dad accepted, I'm excited for when it happens! Though they still need to come up with the time, date, what we need and how we'll meet.

My dad wants to make Oden. 
Oden is a japanese broth/stew with many ingredients. 
I've been tasked with finding things that we should put into it.
Looking at recipes and pictures, there's
- Boiled eggs
- Daikon
- Fishballs
- Fishcakes
- Chikuwa(fried fish paste cooked on skewer)
  Chikuwa has another version called Yaki-Chikuwa.
  It's thicker and longer than normal, specifically used for simmering.
- Hanpen(ground fish, yam, eggs)
- Ball(fried ground fish w/ veggies)
- Mochi Kinchaku(filled fried tofu "pouches")
- Kombu (can be used to flavor or eat)
- Karashi (japanese mustard)
Some things i'd like to add myself
- Chicken
- Potato
- Shrimp
- Tofu
- Chicken hearts(dad and sister want it)
- Carrot
- Mushroom
- Scallop
- Zucchini
Notes I found
- Leaving Oden to sit is good, allows ingredients to absorb
- Oden is traditionally simmered for an hour before eating. But screw that!
- Pre-packed oden kits can also be bought. Better used for one person

I think this'll be enough. I'll add more tomorrow if whe I come up with more ideas. Could this be possibly... Bussin?
