# journal-2022
what I do everyday, but now in 2022 and further!

## July 19, 2022. 
  This marks the beginning of my journal. I'll be talking about either my training with coding or just everyday life. Today my family and I made Char Siu, which is a Cantonese barbecued pork. We messed up on the marinade, adding all  of the ingredients in the recipe instead of just the marinade ones. We had to remake the marinade, but it turned out good. This summer I've been playing alot of modded Terraria with my friends. Terraria is an 2d action/adventure game. The mod we use is called Calamity, which adds multiple bosses, weapons, and armor and a new class, the Rogue. I chose the Rogue for my new playthrough and I've been having a great time. Rogue has a stealth meter, which allows altered, stronger attacks when charged. Bosses' hp goes goodbye! Though I feel like my friends can't really keep up since they have an hour or so to play, while I can play as much as I want. There's a very late game weapon you can get from the start of the game called the Murasama. While you can get Murasama very early, you need to have a special ID or defeat a lategame boss to unlock it. My friends found the ID and now are constantly begging me to let them destroy bosses with it. I say no because it will ruin the game progression. But maybe I'll just let them have fun.
